The town in which [[Iscin|Omra]] and [[Sister|Iscin]] grew up, along with their parents. It was small, small enough that most people who lived there had multiple roles, but it was a seemingly-ancient place, built on the forgotten ruins of an old city. No one had the time or means to really investigate what was already lost. 

Years ago, when it came time for the stoking of their Sun, Ruvan was meant to take care of finding the leyfount but failed, one way or another. As a result the Sun died out, and the town went cold. No one could afford to stay and try to scrape together such a small and desolate place, so it became quickly abandoned.
