Mother to Iscin and Omra, wife to Ruvan.

She originally came from the Yatal region, but only just over the border. She never had the opportunity to make anything of it, but she had a passion for books and archiving; she kept Ruvan's personal library well organized. She fell ill and died when her oldest child was only 7.
