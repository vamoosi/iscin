The true Iscin Irascu. She fell ill at a young age after moving to the cabin with her [[father|Ruvan]] and her older sister, [[Iscin|Omra]]. She had a close relationship with her sister, but when their father died, something fell apart in Omra, and after a year Omra enacted a fire ritual to cremate and sacrifice Iscin before her own death.
