Father to Iscin and Omra, husband to Unra. 

He was a priest and a scryer first, but learned to be a farmer in Halfglow to lend a hand. Simultaneously very down-to-earth but also quite religious. He believed in a somewhat common set of deities of warmth, earth, and freeze and taught this belief to his daughters. It didn't seem to stick for Omra, but she had given up on religion entirely. 

He failed to scry for leylines in Halfglow, whether due to natural challenges or the stress of losing his wife and caring for two children. This caused the Sun in Halfglow to go out, which resulted in Halfglow being abandoned and Ruvan and his family being outcast.
